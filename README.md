# Trie

Implementation of a Trie Data structure in C++ as a usable Library.
To build follow these steps.
1. cmake CMakeLists.txt
2. make clean
3. make

To run examples do the below.
./Example1.out
./Example2.out

The performance statistics of the Trie are below in a same case of two runs with second one having a million words to deal with.

Total Time Taken to insert 370099 words is = 1495 MilliSeconds.
Total Time Taken to fetch all 370099 words is = 177 MilliSeconds.
Total size of Trie in memory = 57556912 bytes [ i.e 57.56 KB ].

Total Time Taken to insert 999999 words is = 3747 MilliSeconds.
Total Time Taken to fetch all 999999 words is = 530 MilliSeconds.
Total size of Trie in memory = 156946160 bytes [ i.e 156.946 MB ].
